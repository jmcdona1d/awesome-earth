intro: The best brands are ones that use ethical production and sustainable materials
---

Sustainable clothing comes in many shapes and forms. One example is through ethical manufacturing which respects both the environment as well as humans living in surrounding areas - such as avoiding the use of harmful dyes. Another form can come from clothing made with natural materials such as:
 * Modal - a breathable material made from beech tree pulp
 * Rayon/Viscose - a manufactured fibre made with wood and plant-based products
 * Bamboo - the bamboo plant makes light-weight, anti-bacterial clothes
 * Hemp - material made from a strain of a cannabis plant 
 * Cotton - a traditional material that is grown from plants
 * Wool - taken off of sheep as they grow it through eating plants
 * Silk - produced by insects and woven into a beautiful material
 * Linen - produced from fibres from the flax plant
 * Cupro - regenerated cellulose made from cotton's waste
